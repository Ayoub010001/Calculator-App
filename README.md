## My process
-During the development of this calculator web app, I started by strated by designing the structure and user interface using HTML and CSS, Then I added Javascript functionalities to handle user behaviours and perform calculations, I used Event listeners to detect button clicks and update the screen display in real time.
-To create a responsive design and make the web app adapts to different screen sizes I used CSS grids and Media queries.finally i tested the functionalites and insure that the three different themes functioning correctly.

### Built with

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties
    - Media Queries
    - CSS Grid
    - JavaScript

### Continued development

-While building this calculator web app was a great learning experience, there are still areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects. In particular, I want to continue to develop my skills in JavaScript to create more complex and interactive web applications.
